*The Character Class
The Character class boxes char, just like Integer boxes int.
It contains methods and constants useful for manipulating characters:
•  Tests:isLetter(),isDigit(),etc.
•  Conversion: toString() (a single character string!)
Escape sequences are used to represent characters that are hard to type:
•  \’,\”,\\,\n, etc.

*The String Class
The String class is provided by Java to store and manipulate strings
(by contrast, in C, a string is simply an array of characters). •  Implicit creation from literal:
             String x = "foo";
•  Thespeciallengthfield:
if (x.length() > 3) ...
•  Concatenation with “+”:
String y = x + "bar";

*Operations on Strings
•  Get a character with charAt()
•  Get a substring with substring()
•  Others:split(),trim(),toLowerCase(),etc •  Finding:indexOf(),contains(),etc
•  Replacing:replace(),replaceAll(),etc
