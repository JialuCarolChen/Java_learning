J8-Nested Classes

*Nested Classes
A class may be defined within another class. Such a class is called a nested class.
The main motivation for nested classes is to improve encapsulation and clarity.
•  Static nested classes (use static keyword) behave as if declared elsewhere,
but happen to be packaged together in a single file, cannot refer directly to instance fields of parent
•  Inner classes (non-static) has direct access to the instance fields and members of its enclosing class.
