Introduction Java-J7: Methods, Parameters, Return values

*Methods
1.A subroutine
-Reusable code
-Modularity, encapsulation
2.May take arguments(parameters)
3.May return a value

*Method Declaration
1.Method declarations will have the following, in order:
-Any modifiers(public, private, etc)
-The method's return type(void)
-The method's name
-The method's parameters, in parentheses
-Any exceptions the method may throw
-The method body(code)

*Parameters
1.Parameters are the mechanism for passing information to a method or constructor.
2.Primitive types passed by value
-Changes to parameter are not seen by caller
3.Reference types passed by value
-Changes to the reference are not seen by caller
-Changes to the object referred to are seen by caller
4.Your last parameter may in fact be more than one parameter(varargs), and treated as an array

*Branching statements(methods)
1.The return statement exits the current method

*Return a Value from a Method
1.Methods return to caller when:
-all statements in method executed, or
-a return statement is reached, or
-the method throws an exception(later)
2.Methods declared void do not return a value. All other methods must return a value of the
declared type(or a subclass of the declared type, described later)
