*The Number Classes
Normally you will represent numbers with the primitive types int, short, float,
etc. Java includes ‘boxed’ object analogues to each of these: Integer, Short, Float, etc.
•  Number classes have methods (primitives don’t) –  toString(), parseInt(), etc.
•  Number classes have constants
–  Integer.MIN_VALUE, Short.MAX_VALUE, etc
•  Number classes have a space overhead –  They are instantiated as true objects

*Autoboxing
Classes such as Integer and Character are ‘boxed’ versions of the primitive types int and char
(i.e. object versions of the primitives). Java offers automatic support for boxing and unboxing.
•  Boxing: Integer i = 5; •  Unboxing: int j = i;

*The Math class
The Math class contains methods and constants useful for basic
mathematics:
•  Constants:Math.PIandMath.E
•  Trigonometry:sin(),cos(),etc.
•  Rounding:abs(),ceil(),floor(),etc.
•  Comparisonfunctions:max(),min()
•  Exponentials and logs: exp(), log(), pow(), etc •  Random number generation: random()
