Classes and Objects O3 - Interfaces

 *Interfaces
 An interface can be thought of as a contract. The implementer of a interface must implement the listed functionality.
 Compared to a class:
  -Uses interface keyword rather than class
  -Cannot be instantiated (can't be created with new)
  -Can only contain: Constants, method signatures (not the bodies), nested types
  -Classes implement interfaces via implements keyword

  *Interfaces as Types
  An interface can be used as a type
  -A variable declared with an interface type can hold a reference to a object of any class that implement that interface
