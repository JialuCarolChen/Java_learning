J9-Lambda Expressions

*Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions allow code to be passed as a parameter, just as data can be. Added to Java in version 1.8.
•  Particularly useful for event handling; can pass behavior as an argument (‘do this when x happens’).
•  Syntax
–  Comma-separated formal parameters (x)
–  Arrow (->)
–  Body (either single expression or statement block, which may contain return)
x->x>100 or x->{...returntrue;}
