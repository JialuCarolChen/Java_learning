from a strictly sequential execution of statements.

*if-then & if-then-else statements
The if-then construct conditionally executes a block of code.
The if-then-else construct conditionally executes one of two blocks of code.

Execution jumps to the first matching case.
Execution continues to the end of the switch unless a break statement is issued
