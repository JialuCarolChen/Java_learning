Introductory Java-J6

*The while & do-while statements
The while statement continuously executes a block while a condition is true.
The do-while construct evaluates the condition at the end of the block rather than at the start.

*The for statement
A compact way to iterate over a set of values.
The statement has three logical parts:
-Initialization
-Termination condition
-Increment statement
The "enhanced" for statement infers the initialization, termination and increment statement, given an array or collection

*Branching statements (loops)
The break statement terminates a loop construct
-Unlabeled terminates the loop in which it is called
-labeled terminates the loop named by the label
The continue statement skips the current iteration of a loop
-Unlabeled skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is called
-Labeled skips the current iteration of the loop named by the label
