*Generics
Sometimes it is useful to parameterize a class with a type, T. Java generics allow us to do this.
Rather than IntContainer, LongContainer, etc, we can just write Container<T>, and then create instances such as Container<Integer>, etc.
Prior to the introduction of Java generics, programmers often used Object as a work-around because it can refer to any non-primitive type.
