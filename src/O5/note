Inheritance 2-java.lang.Object, Final classes, methods and fields, Abstract classes and methods

*Object as superclass
In Java all classes ultimately inherit from one root class: java.lang.Object. Implemented methods:
•  clone() returns copy of object
•  equals(Object obj) establishes equivalence
•  finalize() called by GC before reclaiming
•  getClass() returns runtime class of the object
•  hashCode() returns a hash code for the object
•  toString() returns string representation of object

*Final Classes and Methods
-The final keyword in a class declaration states that the class may not be subclassed.
-The final keyword in a method declaration states that the method may not be overridden.

*Abstract Classes and Methods
-The abstract keyword in a class declaration states that the class is abstract, and therefore cannot be instantiated (its subclasses may be, if they are not abstract).
-The abstract keyword in a method declaration states that the method declaration is abstract; the implementation must be provided by a subclass.
